This folder is for [load-grunt-tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/load-grunt-tasks), which thinks
everything starting with `grunt-` has to provide grunt tasks.
It will look for the `tasks` folder, wouldn't find one and complain.
Well - here is an empty folder without any tasks - be happy, [load-grunt-tasks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/load-grunt-tasks)!
